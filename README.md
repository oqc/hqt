# Haskell Quran Toolkit

A library for dealing Quranic data that provides following features:

* A parser for references (and soon [data formats](https://github.com/oqc/qdf)).
* Data types for Quranic data and utility functions to deal with them.
* And more to come... (see [TODO](https://raw.github.com/oqc/hqt/master/TODO)).
