# TODO

* Nice GHCI integration
* Format parsers
* Investigate replacing Int with Word8
* Add more specs
* Provide unicode/arab/etc support, so:
* It can serve as the basis for 19-claim replication suite
* Add benchmark (need newer HP for that, 7.6 would be nice)
* Break up Types into QRefRng and QDF
